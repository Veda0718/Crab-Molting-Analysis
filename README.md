# Cracking the Code: Unraveling Size Dynamics Before and After Molting

## Project Overview
This project examines the size dynamics of crabs before and after molting using a dataset from Washington State. The primary goal is to analyze the changes in crab shell sizes due to molting, determine if these changes are statistically significant, and understand their ecological implications.

## Key Questions
 - What disparities exist in the sizes of crab shells before and after molting?
 - Is there a statistically significant difference in the average shell sizes before and after molting?
 - How does the difference in mean size before and after molting contribute to understanding the impact of molting on crab shell sizes?

## Findings
 - Crabs exhibit a significant increase in shell size after molting, averaging around 14.69 mm.
 - The effect size, calculated as Cohen's d, is 0.96, indicating a large and consistent impact of molting on crab growth.
 - Statistical tests, including a paired t-test and Monte Carlo simulations, confirm that the observed size differences are highly significant (p < 0.0001).

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that molting has a profound and statistically significant impact on crab growth. This process is crucial for crab development, survival, and adaptation within their habitats. The findings emphasize the need for continued research and conservation efforts to support crab populations and their ecosystems.
